Review Questions

1-Which data type would for each of the following kinds of data:

a-The population of East Simpleton: unsigned long long or uint64_t

b-The cost of a movie in DVD: float

c-The most common letter in this chapter: char

d-The number of times that the letter occurs in this chapter: unsigned int or uint32_t

2-Why would you use a type long variable instead of type int?

	Because the number/s is greater than the maximum int value for the given
system.

3-What portable types might you use to get a 32-bit signed integer, and what
would the rationale be for each choice?

	I would use fixed size integer types, such as int32_t, defined in the
sdint.h library header file.

4-Identify the type and meaning, if any, of each of the following constants:

a- '\b' Escape character
b- 1066 Integer type
c- 99.44 Floating point type
d- 0XAA Integer type, formatted in hexadecimal type
e- 2.0e30 Floating point number, scientific format

5-Dottie Hawn has concoted an error-laden program. Help her find the mistakes.

include <stdio.h>
main
(
float g; h;
float tax, rate;
g = e21;
tax = rate*g;
)

Pound sign missing in include statement.
Main function has to have type and parenthesis for arguments, and 'void'
keyword if no arguments are used.
Semicolon is only mandatory at the end of the floating point variable
declarations, otherwise it will be a syntax error.
If 'g = e21' is an hexadecimal assignment operation, the '0x' or '0X'
is missing.

Fixed version:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    float g, h, tax, rate;
    
    g = 0xE21;
    tax = rate * g;
}

6-Identify the data type (as used in declaration statement) and the printf()
format specifier for each of the following constants:

a-12	integer		int
b-0X3	integer		int
