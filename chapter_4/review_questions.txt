1. Run rev_question_1 C project and write your first and last name when it asks
for your first name. What happens? Why?

	When I entered my full name, I gave three inputs: "Jos√©" "Manuel" and
"Salgueiro". scanf() reads an input until it reaches a blank and then stops
reading. My middle name and lastname went to the next scanf() statements. That
is the reason for the unexpected results.

2. Assuming that each of the following examples is part of a complete program,
what will each one print?

	a. printf("He sold the painting for $%2.2f.\n", 2.345e2);

	He sold the painting for $234.50

	b. printf("%c%c%c\n", 'H', 105, '\41');

	Hi!

	c.
	#define Q "His Hamlet was funny without being vulgar"

	printf("%s has %d characters.\n", Q, strlen(Q));

	His Hamlet was funny without being vulgar has 41 characters.

	d. printf("Is %2.2e the same as %2.2f?\n, 1201.0, 1201.0);

	Is 1.20e3 the same as 1201.00?

3. In Question 2.c, what changes could you make so that string Q is printed out
enclosed in double quotation marks?

	To be able to print out the string Q enclosed in double quotation marks
we have to use the escape character \":

	printf("\"%s has %d characters.\"\n", Q, strlen(Q));

4. It's find error time

define B booboo
define X 10

main(int)
{
	int age;
	char name;

	printf("Please enter your first name.");
	scanf("%s", name);

	printf("All right, %c, what's your age?\n", name);
	scanf("%f", age);

	xp = age + X;

	printf("That's a %s! You must be at least %d.\n", B, xp);
	rerun 0;
}

-The define preprocessor directives have the # character missing
-There are no #include preprocessor directives to include standard I/O library
functions.
-int main(void) instead of main(int)
-When entering the age value, scanf uses a float format specifier instead of an
integer one.
-'xp' variable is not defined.
-printf()'s third parameter is a variable not defined.
-return 0; instead of rerun 0;

Revised version of the program:

#include <stdio.h>
#define B booboo
#define X 10

int main(void)
{
	int age, xp;
	char name;

	printf("Please enter your first name.");
	scanf("%s", name);

	printf("All right, %c, what's your age?\n", name);
	scanf("%d", age);

	xp = age + X;

	printf("That's a %s! You must be at least %d.\n", B, xp);
	return 0;
}

6. What conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?

	a. A decimal integer with a field equal to the number of digits. "%*d", number_of_digits, decimal_integer
	b. A hexadecimal integer in the form 8A in a field width of 4. "%4X"
	c. A floating-point number in the form 232.346 with a field width of 10. "%10.3f"
	d. A floating-point number in the form 2.33e+002 with a field width of 12. "%12.2+e"
	e. A string left justified in a field of width 30. "%30s
